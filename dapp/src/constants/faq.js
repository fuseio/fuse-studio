    question: 'How can I integrate credit/debit payments in my community?',
    answer: `After first launching your community you can add a payment gateway by adding it in the plug-ins page. You will need to switch on the gateway you choose and a "top up" menu item will appear to the users of your community on the mobile app. The payment gateways vary between different jurisdictions and banking integration options like credit/debit cards and wire transfers. Our payment integrations are: Transak, Moonpay.`,

  //   question: 'What is the Fuse chain and how it helps my community?',
  //   answer: `The Fuse chain is a public payments network bridged to Ethereum. The Fuse chain allows entrepreneurs to create communities on the Blockchain using an easy to use tool for community managers called the Fuse Studio. Using the Fuse Studio, entrepreneurs can create a community entirely governed on the Blockcahin with permission managements, token issuance, and tap into powerful business logic and service providers. Using the Studio, the entrepreneur issues a standard token (ERC-20) on the Etheruem Mainnet and using the bridge to move the asset to the Fuse chain for much cheaper and faster transactions (Read here to learn more). The Fuse chain can support any type of coin existing on Ethereum and other blockchains in the future. Entrepreneurs that use the bridge to move to the Fuse chain will be able to add new functionality to their token with almost no effort including adding the token to a white label wallet or manage it distribution. All of those tools are out of the box and free to use on the Fuse chain.`
